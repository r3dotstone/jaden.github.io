# Jaden's Portfolio

This website is a place for me to document projects and ideas in a way for other people to see them. It is continually evolving and improving as I learn learn more, make more, and get better at building a website. The website is built using GitHub Pages with a Jekyll theme and the pages are coded in a combination of GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) and HTML.
