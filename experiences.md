## Here Are Some Important (or Interesting) Experiences That I Have Had

### Electric Plane Flyover

During the 2022 Lafayette-Lehigh rivalry football game, I was responsible for the live footage shot from an electric plane that my friend, Remy Oktay ([check it out here](https://www.lehighvalleynews.com/school-news/higher-education/2022-11-19/student-pilots-battery-powered-airplane-over-historic-lehigh-lafayette-football-game)). I coordinated the acquisition of the video equipment to transmit the video, set up the equipment on game day, operated the camera, and coordinated the communication of the broadcast crew, film crew, and plane crew.

### High School Robotics

During highschool, my friend, my now-girlfriend, and I resurected our FIRST Robotics Competition team after it hadn't competed for 3 years and had an offical budget of $0. Here is a video of our robot, made from old, spare parts, working! It was designed this way to allow for range and orientation adjustment of the ball-launcher without having to be in a specific spot on the field.
