## Here are Some of the Cool Things that I've Done in my Classes

### ES302: Robotics Systems and Design
This course was gave us a broad understanding of the different ways to control a robot. It focussed on real hardware and software integration, meaning that we also learned how to rigosously troubleshoot eratic platforms. Schemes that we implemented include: 
- procedural control
- finite state machines
- transformation and rotation matrices
- odometry
- quaternions
- forward and inverse kinematics
- the Jacobian and joint/configuration space
- wrench and twist
- proportional control
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- computer vision and convolution
- basic simultaneous localization and mapping

#### Final Project: Simulating a User-Demand Blended Power Hybrid

A parallel course of study during the course was the developement of a research project following the rigorous academic process. We conducted developed search protocol, conducted literature screening, and wrote a literature review of the existing research in the field our proposed final project published on IEEE Xplore. We concluded the semester by tackling our projects either in simulation or physical realization, writing a comprehensive resarch article, and creating a project poster to be presented alongside senior design projects.

My project was to assess the feasability of a parallel blended power compensation (PBPC). This means that I build a simulation of a hybrid car that mixes power directly from an ICE and electric motor such that the electric motor contributes enough power to bring the total power up to an ideal quantity that varies with RPM and throttle position. Please see the poster and video below for more details.

### ECE 322: Introduction to Solid State Devices and Circuits

In this class we learned how to both analyze and design circuits constructed of low-level solid state components including op-amps, diodes, and transistors. For our final project we were tasked in pairs to design transmitter and reciever circuits to transform audio signals to optical ones and back. Below are snippets of work from that project.

### CE181: Cities

I took this course while studying abroad in Bonn, Germany. It gave us crucial insight into the engineering and it's societal effects within urban areas. I researched and analyzed zoning's effect on people throughout different cities that I visited while in Europe. Below is the presentation, but you can read the full paper <a href= "https://r3dotstone.github.io/portfolio/media/CitiesFinalPaperFD_04.29.pdf" target="_blank"> here </a>.

### EGRS251: Introduction to Public Policy

This class is crucial to the integrative engineering major, giving us a framework to understand engineering in the context of government and society. We learned and modeled the policy-making process, analyzing how engineering interacts with it. I examined the policy landscape surrounding the right to repair, using my technical knowledge to inform my analysis and recommendations.
