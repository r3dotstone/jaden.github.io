### About Me

Hi! My name is Jaden Stone. I am an enthusiastic maker who wants to use engineering to do good things. I am just as comfortable in the thoeretical world as I am in the shop. 

I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Integrative Engineering, with a focus in robotics at Lafayette College. This means that I take classes in both mechanical and electrical engineering, and tie them together with courses focussed in cross-dicipline systems thinking. In systems courses, I learn about modeling mechanical, electrical, fluid, thermal, and chemical systems using analagous methods (equivalent circuits) and applying those methods to robotics. You can look [here](https://inte.lafayette.edu/) for more details.
